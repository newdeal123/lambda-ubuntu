# Lambda-Ubuntu
Setting up the Ubuntu environment by docker image in AWS Lambda.   
The practice here is not a basic image provided by AWS, but a way to set up a new environment (Alpine, Ubuntu, etc.) when needed. If it works well in the existing Amazon Linux environment, there is no need to use this method.

If you are curious about the detailed implementation method and process, please refer to my blog. But if the chord is weird, please leave a comment! You're always welcome.
